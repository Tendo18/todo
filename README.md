#Todo Api
A To-Do API is a backend service that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) to-do tasks. It typically includes endpoints for managing tasks, setting priorities, due dates, and completion status. 
The API can be used in task management applications, supporting authentication, user-specific task lists, and optional integrations with notifications or reminders.
